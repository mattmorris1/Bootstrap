			<p> I am a student at Boise State University. I aspire to be the creative director for a successful video game one day. I have been very interested in television and video games for most of my life and have always found fictional worlds to be more interesting than the real world. I want to create games and entertainment that people can use to escape from their everyday problems and feel a sense of excitement and wonder.</p>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to showcase the artifacts that I have created in my classes for the GIMM program at Boise State University. I have created and added several artifacts to this website that showcase what I have accomplished so far in my studies.</p>
			<p><a  href="Dragon Defense/DragonDefense.html">Dragon Defense</a> was the first game that I created in my time at GIMM. It is a simple point and shoot game where you play as a dragon and attempt to stop knights from stealing your gold. Use your mouse to aim the dragon and press space to shoot a fireball.</p>
			<p><a  href="CassleHassle/CassleHassle.html">Cassle Hassle</a> was the first group game that I helped to create. The game has you overlooking a town that is being destroyed by a dragon. Your job is to click and place warriors to fight the dragon and try to kill him before he eats too many villagers.</p>
			<p><a  href="Interactive Comic/Comic Updated_Final.html">The Wall</a> was an interactive comic that I helped to create by doing some of the coding and some of the art work. While the comic did not live up to all of our expectations and has some bugs, I am quite proud of the work that I did on it, and I would one day like to go back and polish it up. To go through the comic you must drag the bricks into the wall as its being built to get the next part of the story.</p>
			<p><a  href="Morris VR Project/Morris VR animation.html">The AR Comic</a> was a short video comic that I created that used an AR trigger to allow the user to watch an animated video over the final frame of the comic. The comic and the video have been uploaded to this website for viewing.</p>
			<p><a  href="http://54.69.181.173/">My wordpress website</a> was a website that I create using wordpress for my GIMM 300 class and shares a domain with this site. The wordpress site is used to hold and access some of the campaign notes for two DnD games that I run.</p>
